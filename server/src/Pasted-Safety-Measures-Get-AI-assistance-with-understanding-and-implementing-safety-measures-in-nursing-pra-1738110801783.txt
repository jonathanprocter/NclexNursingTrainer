What are best practices I should know
There are numerous best practices in nursing that prioritize patient safety and risk reduction. These practices are often based on guidelines from reputable organizations such as the American Nurses Association (ANA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Here are a few key ones:

1. **Hand Hygiene**: The WHO guideline on hand hygiene in healthcare asserts that maintaining hand hygiene is the most important measure for preventing healthcare-associated infections. This includes washing hands before and after patient contact, before putting on and after removing protective gloves, and after handling any bodily fluids.

2. **Patient Identification**: The ANA's standard states that nurses must correctly identify patients before administering medications, treatments, or procedures. This often involves checking the patient's wristband and asking the patient to verify their name and date of birth.

3. **Medication Administration**: Nurses should follow the "Five Rights" of medication administration: right patient, right medication, right dose, right time, and right route. Moreover, nurses should also consider additional "rights" like right documentation, right reason, right response, and right to refuse.

4. **Fall Prevention**: The CDC reports that falls are the leading cause of injury and death in older individuals. Nurses can assess patients for fall risk factors (like advanced age, history of falls, or certain medications) and implement strategies like non-slip socks, bed alarms, and regular rounding to prevent falls.

5. **Pressure Ulcer Prevention**: The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel recommends regular skin assessments, use of pressure-relieving devices, and repositioning immobile patients every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers.

6. **Infection Control**: Nurses should follow standard precautions (like using personal protective equipment) and transmission-based precautions (for patients known or suspected to be infected with certain pathogens) to prevent the spread of infections. 

7. **Communication**: Effective communication is crucial for patient safety. This includes clear handoff communication during shift changes, using tools like SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) for structured communication, and involving patients and families in care decisions.

Critical thinking and clinical judgment are crucial in applying these best practices. For example, when administering medication, a nurse might notice that a normally alert patient is unusually drowsy. Even if the medication order seems appropriate, the nurse should use their clinical judgment to consider factors like potential side effects, drug interactions, and the patient's overall condition before proceeding. 

Similarly, in preventing falls, a nurse might notice that a patient is more unsteady on their feet after starting a new medication. The nurse should critically assess the situation, consider the risk of falls, and perhaps suggest a medication review or additional fall prevention measures.

In all these practices, ongoing risk assessment is crucial. Nurses should continually reassess patients as their conditions and situations change, adjust their care plans as necessary, and always prioritize patient safety.
